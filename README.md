### This project is an evaluation of the art-of-the-state metaphor identification algorithm DeepMet. For more information, please check their page
### to intall requirements:
####     pip install -r requirements.txt
### We merged the filtration of test data and evaluation on one notebook. With prediction and test data provided, you can skip the first two parts. We high recommend to start at 3(2). In case you need to use our pre-trained model for step(1), you can have access to it through the link:

### The model is trained with original version of DeepMet on VUAMC corpus with the following parameters:
#### max length = 128, batchsize = 64, dropout rate = 0.1, n-fold = 2, hidden size = 768, random state = 2020, validation split = 0.2, learning rate = 2e-5, epochs = 3
